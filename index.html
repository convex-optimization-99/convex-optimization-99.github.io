<h1 id="intro">About Me</h1>

<p>
Hello! I'm Mr. Funnybunny
–
a math enthusiast, tech advocate, deep thinker, and above all, a people person.
I'm passionate about math, convex optimization, technology, AI, cognitive science, natural sciences,
biotech, medical tech &amp; science, philosophy, theology, history, enlightenment, and mindfulness,
but more than anything else,
I love exploring the intersections of technology with business, markets, economy, sustainability, and society.
</p>

<p>
I am a firm believer in the power of human connection and the importance of finding meaning and values in our communities,
rather than blindly pursuing development and progress, especially in the realms of technology and economy.
(You can find out more about me <a href="/about">here</a> especially around my professional life.)
</p>

<p>
Welcome to my space, where I share my insights and values.
