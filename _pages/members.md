[Jong-Han](https://jonghank.github.io/){:target="_blank"} is an Associate Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at [Inha University](https://www.inha.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}. His research bridges control theory, optimization, and aerospace applications, with particular focus on decentralized optimal control, spacecraft guidance and control, and first-order optimization methods for real-time aerospace applications.

He earned his Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where he worked under the supervision of Professor Sanjay Lall with Professor Stephen Boyd serving as co-advisor. His doctoral research centered on decentralized and cooperative optimal control problems, developing fundamental theory for separable optimal control and quadratically invariant systems. His research expertise spans decentralized and cooperative optimal control for multi-agent systems, spacecraft attitude control and trajectory optimization using convex optimization techniques, powered descent guidance for planetary landing missions, first-order optimization methods with expansive projection for handling nonconvex constraints, and control allocation algorithms for aerospace vehicles. His work uniquely combines rigorous optimization theory with practical aerospace engineering challenges.

Prof. Kim has made significant contributions to optimal control theory, particularly in establishing conditions under which separable two-player optimal control problems admit explicit solutions. His 2015 IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control paper "Explicit Solutions to Separable Problems in Optimal Cooperative Control" provided fundamental theoretical results that have influenced subsequent work in distributed control. More recently, his research on powered descent guidance using first-order methods with expansive projection has introduced novel approaches to handling nonconvex constraints directly, rather than relying on traditional relaxation techniques like lossless convexification. His recent work on spacecraft attitude control demonstrates practical applications of convex optimization to real-world aerospace systems, developing control allocation algorithms using linear programming and quadratic programming that optimize thruster force distribution for spacecraft maneuvering.

Prof. Kim's teaching portfolio includes courses on Optimization (ASE7030), Optimal Control (ASE6029), Machine Learning (LEO6006), Control Design (ASE3093), and foundational courses in computation and linear algebra. His research has been supported by the Korea government through multiple grants including the KSLV-II Enhancement Program, Space Challenge Program, and KRIT grant for Reusable Unmanned Space Vehicle Research. His work bridges theoretical advances in optimization and control with practical aerospace applications, making him an ideal contributor to discussions on how convex optimization fundamentals connect to cutting-edge aerospace engineering challenges.
