[Kihwan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kihwan-choi-b8939210/){:target="_blank"} is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence at [Seoul National University of Science and Technology (SeoulTech)](https://www.seoultech.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}. His research focuses on developing artificial intelligence technologies for medical imaging, with particular expertise in CT imaging, endoscopy, image restoration, noise reduction, and automated diagnosis systems.

He earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} (2014)
where he worked under the supervision of [Prof. Stephen Boyd](https:web.stanford.edu/~boyd){:target="_blank"} and Lei Xing on compressed sensing and optimization methods for medical imaging. During his doctoral studies, he also completed an M.S. in Statistics (2012) and an earlier M.S. in Electrical Engineering (2008) from Stanford. He holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr){:target="_blank"} (2004, 2006).
Before joining SeoulTech in 2023, Prof. Choi served as a Senior Researcher at the [Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)](https://eng.kist.re.kr/){:target="_blank"} from 2017 to 2023, and as a Staff Researcher at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology from 2014 to 2017. His industry experience includes developing AI-based medical imaging solutions and advanced optimization algorithms for clinical applications.

His research lab specializes in self-supervised learning-based image restoration and denoising techniques for low-dose CT imaging, addressing the critical challenge of minimizing patient radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic image quality. This work overcomes the practical limitation of insufficient clinical training data by developing generalizable algorithms applicable across diverse clinical environments. Recent achievements include developing cyclic conditional diffusion models for cross-modal medical image synthesis and computer-aided diagnosis systems for colorectal cancer detection with explainable AI features to enhance clinical trust and usability.

Prof. Choi has published extensively in leading journals including Medical Physics, Expert Systems with Applications, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, and Physics in Medicine and Biology. His pioneering work on compressed sensing-based cone-beam CT reconstruction using first-order methods, developed during his Stanford doctorate, has been widely cited and influenced subsequent research in accelerated medical imaging. He has also contributed to research on brain-computer interface (BCI) platforms, AR/VR device control, and medical robotics systems.

<!--
He holds multiple U.S. patents on deep learning-based image processing, autonomous driving model training, tomography reconstruction, and object recognition systems. His research projects have been supported by major funding agencies including the National Research Foundation of Korea, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and KIST. Most recently, he received the prestigious Young Investigator Grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (2025-2028) for his work on cyclic generative AI and self-supervised learning models for soft tissue prediction from low-dose abdominal CT images.

Prof. Choi's unique background spanning convex optimization theory (through his work with Stephen Boyd), compressed sensing, first-order methods, and cutting-edge deep learning positions him to contribute valuable perspectives on the intersection of classical optimization and modern AI approaches. His work demonstrates how foundational optimization principles continue to inform and enhance contemporary machine learning solutions in high-stakes applications like medical imaging.
